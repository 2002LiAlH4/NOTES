## Exercise

### part1

***How can you perform better in your review search?***
Choose the right search terms: Use specific and relevant keywords related to your topic of interest. Think about synonyms, alternative terms, acronyms, or variations that may be used in the literature.

Utilize advanced search techniques: Take advantage of search operators and filters provided by search engines or databases. These include Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT), quotation marks for exact phrases, wildcard characters for variations, and truncation symbols for word endings

Use specialized databases and search engines: Look beyond general search engines and explore specialized academic databases and search tools tailored for research literature, such as PubMed, IEEE Xplore, or Google Scholar.

Save and organize your search results: Use reference management tools (such as Mendeley, Zotero, or EndNote) to save, organize, and annotate the articles you find. This will make it easier to revisit and cite them in your work.

***What is a reference manager tool? Why is it helpful?***
A reference manager tool is a software application that helps researchers, academics, and students organize and manage their bibliographic references.
Reasons:
It stores all your research in one place so it’s easy to find, organize, and use.
It's easily remember, access, and recognize sources found weeks or months ago.
It saves time formatting your articles or papers.
It shares bibliographies or even full text with collaborators.

***What are some reference manager tools that you can use?***
You may try using bibliographic softwares like Mendeley EndNote, Zotero, CITAVI, Reference Manager or BibTEX.

### part2

***What does iterative process in scientific work mean?***
![](images/scientific%20process.png)
Science circles back on itself so that useful ideas are built upon and used to learn even more about the natural world.This often means that successive investigations of a topic lead back to the same question, but at deeper and deeper levels. 
The iterative process are organized into four main areas or topics,each represented by a colored circle:
/ Exploration and discovery(pink circle)
/ Testing ideas(green circle)
/ Community analysis and feedback(purple circle)
/ Benefits and outcomes(blue circle)
***What activities are scientists engaged with in the Within the Exploration and Discovery area of the iteration cycle?***
There are many different activities that can start a scientist’s journey of exploration and discovery.  These different activities are shown as arrows leading into the Exploration and Discovery area.

They include:
New technology
Curiosity
Practical problem
Personal motivation
Serendipity (e.g., being hit on the head by the proverbial apple)
Surprising observation

***What is the largest and most important of the four areas in the iteration cycle?  How would you define scientific testing?***
This is the largest of the four areas is the **Testing Area** and is at the center of the diagram.  It is divided into two sections:
It is divided into two sections:Gathering data and interpreting data.
These two areas are connected by arrows,showing that scientists move back and forth between them as they test ideas.
The Gathering data section includes three entities that are connected linearly:
/ Hypotheses
/ Expected results or observations
/ Actual results or observations

The interpreting data section includes one statement("Supportive,contradictory,surpring,or inconclusive data may...")that leads to four posssible outcomes:
/ support a hypothesis
/ oppose a hypothesis
/ inspire a revised/new hypothesis
/ inspire revised assumptions

### part3

***How would you describe data interpretation?***
![](images/digging%20into%20data.png)


***What activities are scientists engaged with in the The Community analysis and feedback area of the iteration cycle?***
The Community analysis and feedback area is also divided into two sections.  

**The top section includes four small-scale activities in which scientists engage:**
Feedback and peer review
Replication
Discussion with colleagues
Publication
These activities are all interconnected by lines, indicating that scientists move back and forth between them as they interact with one another in the scientific community.

**The bottom section of the Community analysis and feedback area includes two large-scale activities in which scientists engage:**
Coming up with new ideas/questions
Theory building

The top and bottom sections of the Community analysis and feedback area are connected by arrows, indicating that small-scale interactions within the scientific community (feedback and peer review, replication, etc.) inform large-scale community activities (such as theory building) and vice versa.

***With regard to the benefits and outcomes area, How can engaging in the scientific process help us?***
Finally, we’ll examine the Benefits and outcomes area. This includes six possible outcomes of the process of science. Engaging in the scientific process can help us:
Develop technology
Address societal issues
Build knowledge
Inform policy
Satisfy curiosity
Solve everyday problems

### part4

***Think about the steps for an optimal study design in your work.  What are the mojor steps you would take for carrying out your study.***
1. Getting started
2. checking all information sources
3. choosing the strategy
4. proving the strategy
5. setting and realising the strategy
6. decisions and implications

***What are some of the frequent fails that you must consider when carrying out your study design?***
1. Already existing data and theories are ignored.
2. Possible Generalisation of results is ignored.
3. Focus on acquiring the data is much higher than on their analysis.
4. There is no quality control of acquired data.
5. Only part of the data is analysed properly.
6. Unbalanced data analysis (Imbalance between descriptive and inferential statistics)
7. Insufficient discrimination between descriptive (explorative) and inferential (confirmatory) findings
