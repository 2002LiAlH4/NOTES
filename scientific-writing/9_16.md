***1. What are some general recommendations about the writing style in scientific articles?***
Every time first write a draft (Outline) and then work on wording!!!

- The simplest writing style is the best
- The clarity of a statement is more important than its brevity
- Avoid unnecessary jargon
- Consider the use of a dictation software (quillbot/grammarly)
- Give the complete draft of you work to a layperson with good language skills for proof-reading

***2. Are there any recommendations with regard to the length of the sentences and paragraphs in scientific articles? Explain***
Length of sentences/paragraphs
Optimal length of sentences:
- Rule of thumb: 15-20 words
- Sentences <12 words: expand
- No more than 40 words/sentence!

Optimal length of paragraph:
- Ca. 150 words are ideal for scientific articles
- Commonly not less than 50 words/paragraph

***3. What are some suggestions regarding abbreviations and acronyms in scientific articles?***
Abbreviate correctly
- **Use abbreviations sparse and consistently**
– They should be a help for the readers*
– Use official abbreviations (e.g. „DIU“ instead of „Dresd. 
Intern. Universi.“)
- **Define abbreviations and acronyms at their first appearance** (e.g. „The American Chiropractic
Association (ACA) just published new guidelines. You can gain access via the ACA website.“)

***4. How should the author deal with sensitive issues or subjects in scientific writing?***
**Emphasize only differences which are relevant**
<font color=red>Be careful when referencing groups:</font>
– "The old", "The disabled", "The abnormal" 
– "The sick were, when compared to the normal, …"
– "Stroke victims, who are tied to a wheelchair…" better: "People with stroke who use a wheelchair"
<font color=red>Gender-sensitive language:</font>
