10.  You have just returned from vacation. During your stay, you learned that there is a rare viral disease there. You decide to have a test carried out after your return, as the chances of recovery are significantly better with early detection than after the outbreak of the disease. A few days after the test, your doctor calls you and tells you that your test is positive. He gave you additionally the following information:
1、In infected persons, tropical fever is detected in 99 % of cases.
On the other hand, 98 % of non-infected people are recognized as healthy.
2、Tropical fever only occurs in about one in every thousand tourists who visit this country
The disease shows no symptoms within the first few days.

The mean value of the differences (pre-value - post-value) is 21.7 mmHg and their standard deviation is 9.7 mmHg. State the 95% confidence interval for the expected value of the differences in the population.
(Note: The 97.5% quantile of the t-distribution with 31 degrees of freedom is 2.04)

24. The Federal Ministry of Health has commissioned a study to examine the effects of aircraft noise on people’s health. One part of the study deals with the subjectively perceived loudness of aircraft noise. To this end, two groups of residents living near Frankfurt Airport’s approach path were given a specially designed questionnaire. Higher values mean a greater perception of loudness. One group of residents has lived in the flight path for more than 25 years, the other group for less than 2 years. It is assumed that people who have lived in the flight path for a long time have a different perception of loudness than new residents.
